# Interactive OSPF Algorithm Visualization and Shortest Path Simulation

This project implements an interactive **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) algorithm visualization tool** using Python and Pygame. It allows users to create custom graphs, representing network nodes and connections, and calculates the shortest path between nodes using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. The tool visually displays the graph, highlights the optimal paths, and dynamically generates routing tables.

## Features
- **Custom Graph Creation**: Add nodes and edges dynamically through user input.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Calculates the shortest path between any two nodes in the graph.
- **OSPF Simulation**: Visual representation of how OSPF would calculate paths in a network.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays graph nodes, edges, costs, and optimal paths in real-time.
- **Dynamic Routing Table**: Shows cost and next-hop neighbor for each node in the network.
- **Path Highlighting**: Visual indication of the shortest path using color-coded lines.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For core algorithm implementation and control logic.
- **Pygame**: For graphical visualization of the graph, routing, and pathfinding.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## User Inputs
- **Number of Nodes**: Enter the number of nodes (routers) in the graph.
- **Node Coordinates**: Specify the (x, y) positions for each node.
- **Edges and Costs**: Enter the start and end nodes for each edge along with the distance (cost) between them.
- **Start and End Nodes**: Specify the source and destination nodes for the shortest path calculation.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of user input and how the program works:

### Input:

- **Number of Nodes**: 7
- **Node Names and Coordinates**:
  - A: (100, 100)
  - B: (200, 150)
  - C: (300, 100)
  - D: (200, 250)
  - E: (400, 150)
  - F: (500, 100)
  - G: (600, 150)

- **Number of Edges**: 9
- **Edges and Distances**:
  - A to B: 2
  - A to C: 5
  - B to C: 6
  - B to D: 1
  - B to E: 3
  - C to F: 8
  - D to E: 4
  - E to G: 9
  - F to G: 7

- **Start node: A**:
- **End node: G**:
